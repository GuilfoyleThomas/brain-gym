### Testing
-------

-   I continuously tested The Brain Gym website using Google Dev Tools, ensuring everything on all devices was working as it should. This proved to be extremely helpful as it allowed me to identify some flaws.
-   I used my personal computer and three other devices, including an iPad, a Samsung Galaxy S21, and an iPhone SE, to test every page rigorously. I used a range of screen sizes, from a 24" desktop monitor to a small mobile phone. I also have a docking station for my computer at home and at work that are plugged into monitors with various screen sizes.
-   My friends and family were very helpful with the testing too, as they helped me spot some flaws.

### Unfixed Bugs
----------
  1.  I couldn't gt the quiz to reset properly. Currently, the quiz has to be completed for the score to return to zero when. Reset when playing will return the score to zero but on a second visit to the page the logged score shows up again.
  2.  I wanted the quiz to continue to the next question when an answer was clicked but I didn't have time. Users have to click the next button below for each question.
  3.  The answers should be turning green for correct and red for incorrect but I have no idea why I couldn't get it working.
